<h1 align="center">Python Project </h1>
Develop a collaborative mini project using Python and the PyQt library, where we will apply data structure and algorithm concepts. This project will allow us to perform various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions on entered data. We will be able to add, delete, and view the data, as well as perform searches based on selected attributes. Additionally, we can sort the data using specific attributes and utilize various sorting algorithms integrated into the project. By clicking the search button after selecting a specific attribute, we can search for relevant data. This project aims to provide a comprehensive range of functionalities for managing and manipulating data while incorporating different data structures and algorithmic techniques.
